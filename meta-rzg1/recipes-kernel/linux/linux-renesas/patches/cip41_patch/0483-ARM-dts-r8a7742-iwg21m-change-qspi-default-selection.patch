Subject: [PATCH 483/557] ARM: dts: r8a7742-iwg21m: change qspi default
 selection

There're a workaround in u-boot to control the selection of qspi and vin2
through GPIO0_18. And when working, VIN2 should be selected as default after
kernel finish  booting. These changes in devide tree to configure VIN2 as
default.
